need if statements, include brackets {}

if expression 
{
    expression;
}

use double == for if statements.
== compare
= assign

no semicolon at end of if statement

booleans -> valid input, how can i use them to skip code? Adding if statement to check for boolean tripped?

cant compare string to char, but can compare char to int

careful testing floats and doubles for equality, 

0 is false, any other value is true

if/else

    else has seperate brackets from the if statement

    if(x == y)
    {
        do this
    }
    else()
    {
        do this other thing
    }

if i cannot get double letters on hangman: in an if/else chain, only 1 statement can execute
